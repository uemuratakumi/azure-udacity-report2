In the project, we can make model by using auto-ML, Pipeline, and python script on Jupyter Notebook.

Any method, we can deploy the model as endpoint(WebAPI).

And we can use the endpoint by sending API key and data to endpoint URL.

In real project, model should update at fixed interval.

The Pipeline support the update automatically.

## key step of how to use Azure-ML

### make data set
We can easity upload file from local PC to Ature-ML.
This is a sample of upload data.
